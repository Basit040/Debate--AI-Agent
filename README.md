# Debate AI Agent ü§ñ‚öñÔ∏è

A sophisticated AI-powered debate simulator built with CrewAI. This project features two specialized AI agents‚Äîa **Debater** and a **Judge**‚Äîthat engage in a structured debate on a user-provided motion, culminating in a reasoned verdict.

## Overview

This application automates a formal debate process:
1. **The Proposition** agent argues in favor of the motion.
2. **The Opposition** agent argues against the motion.
3. **The Judge** agent impartially evaluates both arguments and declares a winner based on the strength and persuasiveness of the cases presented.

It's a powerful tool for exploring complex topics, testing arguments, and demonstrating the capabilities of multi-agent AI systems.

## Features

- **Dual-Agent Debate:** Two distinct AI agents generate opposing arguments on any given topic.
- **Impartial Adjudication:** A dedicated judge agent provides a final verdict and reasoning.
- **CrewAI Framework:** Leverages CrewAI for agent orchestration and task management.
- **Persistent Outputs:** All arguments and the final decision are saved to markdown files for easy review.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify the agents' roles, goals, or the LLM they use.
